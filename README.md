# TrafficSignRecognitionWithGridSearch
The application was written in Python using several libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn. The latter library allowed me to use the GridSearch tool which allowed me to adjust the structure of the neural network accordingly to maximize the efficiency of the network's performance.

GTSRB- German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. Data set that was used for training and test process.
